accepted by GRSL DOI: 10.1109/LGRS.2024.3386020

## Updates
- (04/2024) Code is released.

## Dataset
SAR-AIRcraft1.0 (doi: 10.12000/JR23043)



## Getting Started

The installation instruction and usage are in [Getting Started with DiffusionDet](GETTING_STARTED.md).

## Train/Evalution:
1. modifying the weight in DiffusionDet-main/configs/Base-DiffusionDet.yaml (use pre-train res50)
2.  modifying the weight in DiffusionDet-main/configs/diffdet.coco.res50.300boxes.yaml
3.  modifying  DiffusionDet-main/detectron2/engine/defaults.py  and the 98-122 line to your root.
4.  As for other configs and their meaning,  [DifffusionDet](https://github.com/ShoufaChen/DiffusionDet) is introduced in detail.
5.  ATTENTIONï¼šIn order to use the code directly and reduce the complexity of the code, I changed the images and annotations of the aircraft dataset into the coco format, and put them in the folder named coco.

## Quantative Results:
Quantitative results of different models evaluated by AP@50. The model weights are available at(I will upload the weight later for it is now uploaded to BAIDU YUN)  You can down load the model weights and put it to the checkpoints folder and modify the weight in DiffusionDet-main/configs/diffdet.coco.res50.300boxes.yaml
